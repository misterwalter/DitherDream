# DitherDream
A short and trippy exploration game in Unity, playable [on itch.io](https://ditherdream.itch.io/ditherdream)

I made this in a few days for [1BitJam](https://itch.io/jam/1-bit-jam-wow) with the objective of turning my new shader knowledge into the most colorful game possible within the confines of an extremely limited palette. It was a really fun challenge, and while I wasn't able to put as much time into it as I would like, people seemed to recieve it well, and I'm happy with the result.

The bulk of the programming complexity of the game is in the shaders, with shadergraph seeing heavy usage throughout. The rest of the code is clean and clear enough, it's just not very complicated.

## This is not the current commercial version of DitherDream. I've rebuilt the game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), you can probably guess why I'm not using Unity anymore. RIP. This repo is largely abandoned, but the project lives on, and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is worth changing for!
Please feel free to learn from it as you will, just don't copy it outright.

# Assets Used
The project won't work as soon as you download it, you'll need to download a few additional free assets to plug in. This is because I am averse to both reinventing the wheel, and to spreading other people's code around without asking, even when it's free. Just feels off, I dunno.
