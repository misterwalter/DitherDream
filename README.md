# DitherDream
A short and trippy exploration game in Unity, playable [on itch.io](https://supreme-hubris.itch.io/ditherdream)


I made this in a few days for [1BitJam](https://itch.io/jam/1-bit-jam-wow) with the objective of turning my new shader knowledge into the most colorful game possible within the confines of an extremely limited palette. It was a really fun challenge, and while I wasn't able to put as much time into it as I would like, people seemed to recieve it well, and I'm happy with the result.

The bulk of the programming complexity of the game is in the shaders, with shadergraph seeing heavy usage throughout. The rest of the code is clean and clear enough though.

# Assets Used
The project won't work as soon as you download it, you'll need to download a few additional free assets to plug in. This is because I am averse to both reinventing the wheel, and to spreading other people's code around without asking, even when it's free. Just feels off, I dunno.

# Future Plans
This is a very fun and easy game to work on, so I'll probably keep expanding it, and I'm considering a mobile release as well. I'd like to grow it into a small commercial-scale game with a dozen or more islands instead of the current three, and that's pretty attainable. In that case, I'll probably make the source code private again, I just had this funny feeling that it might be a good idea to have some Unity source code visible on my github right now.
